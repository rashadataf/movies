### How to run it locally?
1. First, you should clone the project into your machine.
    You can do that by two methods :
    - You can clone the GitHub repository, just go to the directory you want to store the files in and open it with your **bash or cmd** and execute
    `git clone https://github.com/rashadataf/movies.git` 
    - you can download the project files as a **zip** file from [here](https://github.com/rashadataf/movies/archive/master.zip) and then extract it where ever you want.

2. After you got the files now go to inside the folder where you kept the downloaded files and open your **bash or cmd** and run `npm install`
   *This will install the required packages for you*.
3. After the installation from the previous step is complete now run `npm start`.
